# simple-camera-pipeline
A simple and light-weight camera image processing pipeline implemented in MATLAB.

Start by running DEMO.m

This is the code used to render the sRGB images from the Raw-RGB images of the [Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD)](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~kamel/sidd/).

This code is helpful for participants of the real image denoising challenges on CodaLab:
[NTIRE 2019 Real Image Denoising Challenge - Track 1: Raw-RGB](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21258)
[NTIRE 2019 Real Image Denoising Challenge - Track 2: sRGB](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21266)

Enjoy!
